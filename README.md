# Blockchain technology overview
<p>
A blockchain is a decentralized virtual ledger for recording transactions about assets without central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. It is made up of three technologies: 

1. cryptographic algorithms, 
1. a distributed protocol, 
1. and replicated data 
<p>
which combined provide a trustworthy service to a group of nodes that do not fully trust each other. 
<p>
An asset can be tangible — a house, a car, cash,  land  —  or  intangible  like  intellectual  property,  such  as 
patents, copyrights, or branding. Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and 
cutting costs for all involved.
<[>
With blockchain, several users can write entries into a block or a record of information, and a community can control how the record of information is modified and updated.

[Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) is an umbrella project of open source blockchains and related tools, started in December 2015 by the Linux Foundation, to support the collaborative development of blockchain-based distributed ledgers.
<p>

[Hyperledger Fabric](github.com/hyperledger/fabric) is an implementation of a distributed ledger platform for running smart contracts, leveraging familiar and proven technologies,  with  a  modular  architecture  allowing  pluggable  implementations  of  various  functions.

# How did it all start?
 
October 2008 It all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his paper [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:
